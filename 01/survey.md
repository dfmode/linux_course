# Survey of the hardware and software you use

Basically no wrong answers except empty ones ;-).

Each (reasonable) answer is worth 5 points.

**Q1** What is your primary operating system that you use
on your desktop/notebook? Writing a family only is sufficient.
When dual-booting, please name both systems.

**[A1]** MacOS **[/A1]**

**Q2** Size of your RAM in gigabytes?
If you have multiple computers, choose just one you use
the most (again, we are interested in desktops/notebooks, not
cell phones or tablets).

**[A2]** 8 gigabytes **[/A2]**

**Q3** What internet connectivity do you have? Please, specify
rough speeds of upload/download. You can use for example
[SpeedTest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) to determine the speeds.
