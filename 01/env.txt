This semester I will be programming in C# in Visual Studio, but for Python programming I prefer Visual Studio code. 
What's appealing about Visual Studio Code is the fact that it's an open source project and its design. 
I also like the Visual Studio interface very much and it is very convenient for writing projects in C#.
For C# , you should use Visual Studio, because Visual Studio code compiles this language for a very long time.
